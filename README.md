### About Me
Building effective and transformational software is my passion. I believe that leading by example, habitual continual learning, and knowledge transfer are core principles that define great developers and make for great development teams. I enjoy reading, blogging, and presenting on new technology as well as other development related subjects. I am always appreciative of thoughtful and constructive feedback from my peers and co-workers - it is hard to improve without it.
