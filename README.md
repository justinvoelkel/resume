### About Me
I've been working professionally as a developer since 2009. I started as a front-end developer focused mainly on writing
quality HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I shifted to a PHP/application focused position in 2013. Since that time I have been primarily
focused on building and maintaining web applications built with PHP and Javascript.

I love learning and building new things. I believe that continual learning and knowledge transfer are core principles that define
good developers and make for good development teams. I enjoy blogging, speaking, and presenting on new technology and development techniques to share the things I've learned.
I am dedicated to writing better software today than I did yesterday and am always open to review and constructive feedback.
